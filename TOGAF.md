# Enterprise Architect

Architecture - The fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution. The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.

An architecture framework is how we do architecture.

## 7 Core Concepts

### The definition of enterprise

"Highest level of description for an organization"

Why enterprise architecture?
To optimize the legacy processes into an intergrated environment that is responsive to change and supportive to the delivery of the business strategy.

Its a balance between business transformation and continuous operational efficiency.

***Benefits***
- More effective and efficient business operations:
  - Lower business operation costs
  - More agile organization
  - Business capabilities shared across the organization
  - Lower change management costs
  - More flexible workforce
  - Improved business productivity
- More effective and efficient Digital Transformation and IT operations
  - Extending effective reach of the enterprise through digital capability
  - Bringing all components of the enterprise into a harmonized environment
  - Lower software development, support, and maintenance costs
  - Increased portability of applications
  - Improved interoperability and easier system and network management
  - Improved ability to address enterprise-wide issues like security
  - Easier upgrade and exchange of system components
- Better return on existing investment, reduced risk for future investment
  - Reduced complexity in the business and IT
  - Maximum return on investment in existing business and IT infrastructure
  - The flexibility to make, buy, or out-source business and IT solutions
  - Reduced risk overall in new investments and their cost of ownership
- Faster, simpler and cheaper procurement
  - Buying decisions are simpler, because the information governing procurement is readily available in a coherent plan
  - The procurement process is faster - maximizing procurement speed and flexibility without sacrificing architectural coherence
  - The ability to procure heterogeneous, multi-vendor open systems
  - The ability to secure more economic capabilities 

What specifically would prompt the development of an Enterprise Architecture?

- Business transformation needs
- Radical infrastructure changes

Role of architects:
- Identifying and refining the requirements that the stakeholders have
- Developing views of the architecture that show how the concerns and requirements are going to be addressed
- Showing the trade-offs that are going to be made in reconciling the potentially conflicting concerns of different stakeholders

#### The architecture framework
- Foundation structure or set of structures
- Describes a method of designing target state of the enterprise
- Show building blocks comprising tools, standards, complaints that will be used.

### The architecture domains, or BDAT

4 sub architectures

B - Business architecture (Business Domain) - Fundamental purpose of the business, current and future capabilities of the business
D - Data architecture (Data Domain) - Logical and physical data assets
A - Application architecture (Application Domain) - Applications focusing on core business process
T - Technology architecture (Technology Domain) - Support system of the business (computers, networks, middlewares and third party applications)



### The architecture development method, or ADM
ADM is a process to define enterprise architecture.

- **The Preliminary Phase** describes the preparation and initiation activities required to create an Architecture Capability including customization of the TOGAF framework and definition of Architecture Principles
- **Phase A: Architecture Vision** describes the initial phase of an architecture development cycle
It includes information about defining the scope of the architecture development initiative, identifying the stakeholders, creating the Architecture Vision, and obtaining approval to proceed with the architecture development.
- **Phase B: Business Architecture** describes the development of a Business Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
- **Phase C: Information Systems Architectures** describes the development of Information Systems Architectures to support the agreed Architecture Vision
- **Phase D: Technology Architecture** describes the development of the Technology Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
- **Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions** conducts initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases
- **Phase F: Migration Planning** addresses how to move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by finalizing a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan
- **Phase G: Implementation Governance** provides an architectural oversight of the implementation
- **Phase H: Architecture Change Management** establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture
- **Requirements Management** examines the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM
