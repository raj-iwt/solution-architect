# Solution Architect's responsibilities

 To convert organization's business visions into a technical solution and work as a liaison between businesses and technical stakeholders.

**Request for response (RFR)** document - Serves as a formal solicitation sent to potential vendors or service providers. The document is used to gather detailed proposals on how they would address a specific project or problem.

## Functional Requirements (FRs)

- Define what systems do
- Define the behaviours, functions and features of system
- Explain user interactions and application's tasks

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- Performance
  - What will the application load time be for users?
  - How can we handle network latency?
- Scalability
  - How can we meet the increasing demand for resources?
  - How can we accommodate scaling for a sudden spike in utilization?
- Usability
  - How can we simplify an application's use?
  - How can we achieve a seamless user experience?
  - How can we make the application accessible to a diverse set of users?
- Reliability
  - How can we make sure the application performs consistently?
  - How do we inspect and correct glitches?
- Security and compliance
  - How can we secure an application from unauthorized access?
  - How can we protect an application from malicious attacks?
  - How do we adhere to local laws and audit requirements?
- Maintainability
  - How can we ensure application monitoring and alerts?
  - How can we ensure application support?
- Availability
  - How can we ensure the high availability of an application?
  - How can we make an application fault-tolerant
- Recoverability
  - How can we recover an application from an outage?
  - How can we minimize recovery time in the event of an outage?
  - How can we recover lost data?

## Architecture constraints

- Cost
  - How much funding is available for solution implementation?
  - What is the expected ROI?
- Quality
  - How closely should outcomes match FRs and NFRs?
  - How can we ensure and track the quality of the solution?
- Time
  - When should the output be delivered?
  - Is there any flexibility regarding delivery time?
- Scope
  - What are the exact expectations from business and customer requirements?
  - How does the requirement gap need to be handled and accomodated?
- Technology
  - What technology can be utilized?
  - What flexibility does using legacy versus new technologies provide?
  - Should we build in-house or source from a vendor?
- Risk
  - What can go wrong and how can we mitigate it?
  - What is the risk tolerance of stakeholders?
- Resource
  - What is required to complete solution delivery?
  - Who will work on the solution's implementation?
- Compliance
  - What are the local legal requirements that might impact the solution?
  - What are the audit and certification requirements?
